Hey. I am Joris. A computer science student and Full-Stack Engineer living in Berlin.

I am particular interested in Blockchain systems / Blockchain integrations and other cool stuff.
Currently I am researching data DAOs for privately sharing and monetizing your data.

If you are interested in Algorithmic games check out my Rust crate I released in crates.io: https://crates.io/crates/backgammon_engine
Feel free to try it out and leave (constructive) feedback.

Lead Engineer on the Student Organizer App Reco. Released soon.

Cheers Joris
